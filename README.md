Landing page and booking MVP to connect volunteer tutors and pupils amidst the
COVID-19 pandemic.

## Volunteer

We are building a massive academic support network and systems to bolster our
educational infrastructure in this difficult time.

If you have expertise in marketing, management, teaching, tech, or just want to
help out we would love to hear from you!

## Our Vision

Included below is a brief outline of our vision for this project.

### The problem

- Students no longer have the individualized support teachers usually have given
  (when they met face-2-face)
- Teachers can no longer attend to each student individually; some students are
  falling behind

### The solution

- Support those students by connecting them to university students and
  professionals also confined in their homes
- Enable teachers to request one-on-one help for students they know are
  struggling

### How you can help

[**@nicholaschiang**](https://github.com/nicholaschiang) is going to be heading
up the dev side of things while [**@alephtaw**](https://github.com/alephta)
works full-time on business (so ask him if you're interested in that). As for
dev, here's what we're working on:

1. Choosing a front-end framework that most of us are familiar with (currently,
   we're going to go with [React](https://reactjs.org) using
   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)).
2. Building out a front-end where students and tutors can sign-up to be
   connected to one another.
3. Building out a back-end to automatically match students with tutors and send
   them three links:
   - Link to video call
   - Link to virtual whiteboard (probably using
     [DrawChat](https://github.com/cojapacze/sketchpad))
   - Link to shared Google Drive folder

### What you can do now

- Head over to our [new Slack workspace](https://covidtutoring.slack.com).
- Check the `#development` channel pins for more information on how you can help
  out.

## Contributing

Check out this project's [documentation](https://covidtutoring.org/docs/)
(automatically generated using [JSDoc 3](https://jsdoc.app)) or head over to our
[main repository](https://github.com/tutorbookapp/tutorbook) and [main
documentation](https://tutorbook.app/docs/) for more detailed information.

Feel free to also check out our recently added `tutorials/` directory for
additional information detailing different aspects of this project (e.g. tests,
deployment workflows, CI/CD, etc).

This project uses:

#### Languages

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - As our language of choice
  (mostly for static typing, stronger linting capabilities, and the potential
  for beautifully detailed--and completely automatically generated--
  documentation). Typescript is also [well supported by
  Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript) and
  [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/static-type-checking.html#typescript).
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - For styling components. Sass, like Typescript,
  is also [well supported by Next.js
  out-of-box](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support)

#### Frameworks

- [React](https://reactjs.org) - As our front-end framework.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - To easily support
  [SSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering) and
  other performance [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) features.

#### Tooling

- [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) - To manage and re-use React components across
  repositories; mostly just to migrate code from this project back into
  [Tutorbook](https://tutorbook.app/docs/) when we get the chance.
- [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) - For code linting to avoid
  common mistakes and to enforce styling. Follow [these
  instructions](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations) to install it
  in the text editor of your choice (such that you won't have to wait until our
  pre-commit hooks fail to update your code).

#### Database

- [Google's Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - For their [NoSQL
  document-based database](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore),
  [Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth), and other
  useful (relatively drop-in) solutions.

### Development Environment

To setup a development environment for and to contribute to the COVID Tutoring
Initiative website:

1. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
   to install `nvm` (our suggested way to use Node.js) on your
   machine. Verify that `nvm` is installed by running:

```
$ command -v nvm
```

2. (Optional) If you use [Vim](https://vim.org) as your preferred text editor,
   follow [these instructions](https://freshman.tech/vim-javascript/) on setting
   up [Vim](https://vim.org) for editing JavaScript.
3. Run the following command to install Node.js v12.16.1 (our current version):

```
$ nvm i 12.16.1
```

4. (Optional) Run the following command to set Node.js v12.16.1 as your default
   Node.js version (useful if you have multiple Node.js versions installed and
   don't want to have to remember to switch to v12.16.1):

```
$ nvm alias default 12.16.1
```

5. Ensure that you have recent versions of Node.js and it's package manager
   `npm` by running:

```
$ node -v
12.16.1
$ npm -v
6.13.4
```

6. Make sure that you have [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org) installed by running:

```
$ npm i -g lerna
```

7. Clone and `cd` into this repository locally by running:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tutorbookapp/covid-tutoring.git && cd covid-tutoring/
```

8. Then, install of our project's dependencies with the following command:

```
$ npm i && lerna bootstrap --hoist
```

9. Then, you'll most likely want to branch off of `develop` and `cd` into our
   [app packages](https://npmjs.com/org/tutorbook) by running:

```
$ git checkout -b $my_branch && cd src/app/packages
```

10. Follow the instructions included below to start a
    [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) development server (to see your updates affect
    the app live).
11. From there, `cd` into your desired package (included in `src/`), make your
    changes, commit them to your branch off of `develop`, [fork our
    repository](https://github.com/tutorbookapp/covid-tutoring/fork), and open a
    PR on GitHub.

#### Code Format

Tutorbook uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to enforce consistent code formatting throughout the codebase.
A pre-commit hook is used to format changed files found on commit, however it is still recommended to install the Prettier plugin in your code editor to ensure consistent code style.

### Available Scripts

All of the below scripts come directly from
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started). In the project directory,
you can run:

#### `npm run dev`

Runs `next` which starts Next.js in development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the
browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint
errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Runs `next build` which builds the application for production usage.

#### `npm run start`

Runs `next start` which starts a Next.js production server.
